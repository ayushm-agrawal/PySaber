# PySaber

PySaber is a simple machine learning library that I am creating to better understand the implementation of different Networks. The goal of this library is just for me to improve my understanding of things like:

- How backpropogation works
- How convolutional networks work
- and so on...

## How to Run?

Will be updated soon

## Known Issues

Currently, the Loss functions are not implemented. We are using PyTorch Loss functions to test our network implementation of a Neural Network.

More details can be found under this [#issue 5](https://github.com/ayushm-agrawal/PySaber/issues/5)
